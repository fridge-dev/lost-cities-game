# Explore the Lost Cities

<cool game lore text goes here, but it doesn't talk about the rules>

# Game Components

60 playing cards:

* 5 different colors (similar to "suits" in playing cards)
* 12 cards per color:
    * One of 2-10
    * Three Wager cards

# Preparation

Shuffle the 60 cards and deal eight to each player, face down. The remaining 44 cards are the draw pile.

# Object of the Game

Both players' goal is to form expedition routes that– after subracting the expidition costs– earn them as many discovery points as possible. You set up the expeditions by forming a separate column of cards for each color. The numeric values within a column of cards must increase from card to card. You can place wager cards at the beginning of each column to multiply a column's value. At the end of the game, the cards in each player's columns are scored.

# Sequence of Play

A random player begins and players alternate turns. Each player only places cards on his or her side of the game board. During your turn, you must first place one of the cards from your hand. Only afterward are you allowed to draw a new card.

## 1. Play a Card

Choose a card from your hand. You have two options:

### 1a. Place a Card in One of Your Own Columns

You can use the card to start a new column on your side or to extend one of the columns you have already started. To do this, place the card face up on your side of the game board, below the space for the discard pile of the corresponding color. You may only place additional cards at the end of a column.

**Important**: Each new card that you place in a column must have a higher value than the most recent card you have placed in this column. Place the cards in a column overlapping each other in such a way that the numbers of all cards are clearly visible.

A **wager card** may only be placed at the beginning of a column. You may place multiple wager cards in a column. However, as soon as you have placed a number card in a column, you no longer may play any wager cards of this column's color.

### 1b. Discard a Card

If you don't want (or can't) place a card in a column, you must place a card from your hand face up on the game board - more specifically, on the space for the discard pile of the corresponding color. In this manner, five discard piles are formed during game play, one for each color. The cards should be placed on the piles so that only the top card is visible.

## 2. Draw a Card

Draw a new card into your hand. You may choose between the top cards of the five discard piles (if cards have been placed there) and the top card of the draw pile. However, you are not allowed to draw the same card you have just discarded. Once you have drawn a card, your turn ends.

# End of the Game

* The game ends as soon as a player draws the last card from the draw pile.
* When the game ends, each player's columns of cards are scored, and the player with the highest score wins.

# Scoring

Score is determined in the following way. **For each column**:

1. If you haven't played any cards, your final score for the column is `0`.
1. If you have played any cards, start with `-20` and contine counting your score.
1. Add the `sum` of all non-wager cards and add it to your `-20`. Note: a column *can* earn you negative points.
1. Apply the following multiplier based on the number of wager cards you played:
    * 0 wagers => `1x`
    * 1 wager  => `2x`
    * 2 wagers => `3x`
    * 3 wagers => `4x`
1. If you've played **eight or more cards**, add a bonus of 20 points (not multiplied by wager multiplier) to your score. This is your final score for the color.

### Scoring Example

* Yellow: 5, 8, 10 => `3 points`
* Blue: <no cards> => `0 points`
* White: Wager => `-40 points`
* Green: Wager, 3, 5, 7 => `-10 points`
* Red: Wager, Wager, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 => `65 points`

Total points: `18 points`
