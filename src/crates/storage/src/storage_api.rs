/// A GameStore is the storage layer of the game engine. It is responsible for durably persisting the state
/// of the game. It is NOT responsible for applying rules of the game to the provided game board state.
///
/// Planning on the following 4 implementations (via Iterative Developmentâ„¢)
///
/// **When game is run as a single process**
/// 1. ProcessLocalStore - In-memory storage for a game (2 clients & 1 server) run on a single process
///
/// **When game is run as 3 separate processes** (1 server and 2 clients)
/// 2. NetworkStore - For client processes, this is external storage accessible via network with the same interface (gRPC-like)
/// 3. ServerLocalStore - For server process, an in-memory (or disk) storage
/// 4. ServerDbStore - For server process, a storage backed by an external DB
///
/// For future proofing, there should be one method per-table per-access-pattern.
///
/// Methods grouped by classic CURD pattern.
