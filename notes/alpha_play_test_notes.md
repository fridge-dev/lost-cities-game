## UI

### High priority and/or simple

* [x] Change card selection to be 1-8
* [x] Show card selection number under the card
* [x] Redraw my selected card
* [ ] Show score-per-color to help players learn how scoring works
* [ ] Make "Welcome to the Lost Cities game!" big and blocky
* [x] Ensure consistent use of "neutral" and "discard"

### Lower priority and/or large effort

* [ ] PROBLEM: More easily learn when it's your turn
  * Add sound? (kind of lame)
  * Make UI very different when it's not your turn
* [ ] Somehow highlight post-turn changes
  * Which card was played
  * Where they drew from
  * Which card I drew
* [ ] Print colored text
* [ ] Clear terminal screen after each board update
* [ ] Change "Opponent's score" to "{player_id}'s score"

## Server

### High priority and/or simple

* [ ] Implement server->client push when opponent plays a card
* [x] Figure out deepak's bug
* [ ] Make client send request ID

### Lower priority and/or large effort

* [ ] Implement instant messaging in game (difficult UI?)
* [ ] Proper login system
* [ ] Ranks/leaderboard
