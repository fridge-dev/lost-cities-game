## UI

### High priority and/or simple

* Change card selection to be 1-8
* Show card selection number under the card
* Change "Opponent's score" to "{player_id}'s score"
* Show score-per-color to help players learn how scoring works
* Make "Welcome to the Lost Cities game!" big and blocky
* Ensure consistent use of "neutral" and "discard"

### Lower priority and/or large effort

* PROBLEM: More easily learn when it's your turn
** Add sound? (kind of lame)
** Make UI very different when it's not your turn
* Somehow highlight post-turn changes
** Which card was played
** Where they drew from
** Which card I drew
* Print colored text
* Clear terminal screen after each board update

## Server

### High priority and/or simple

* Implement server->client push when opponent plays a card
* Figure out deepak's bug
* Make client send request ID

### Lower priority and/or large effort

* Implement instant messaging in game (difficult UI?)
